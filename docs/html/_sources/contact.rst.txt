The best way to contact us is to stand at the bar at The SCR on a Friday evening at around 06:00 pm and shout one of the phrases below. Almost immediately one member of Sappo club will make themselves known:

- "Understanding the weather in the tropics is easy. It gets hot, clouds build and it rains. Simple as that."

- "Why do we need to have different names for different clouds? Surely they're all the same."

- "I don't get it. Why can't we just use the weather app instead of all this complex modeling?"

- "I base all my expectations for upcoming weather events on Daily Express headlines."
